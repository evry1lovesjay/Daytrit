      TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      Welcome to DayTrit mobile app and all it’s applicable domains (including sub-domains
      associated with them), related software applications (sometimes referred to as
      “apps”), data, SMS, A Pis, email, chat and telephone correspondence, buttons, widgets and ads (collectively, all of these items shall be referred to herein as the
      “Services”; more generally, the DayTrit mobile app shall hereinafter be referred to
      herein as “app”). The Services are offered to you conditioned upon your acceptance of
      the terms, conditions, and notices set forth below (collectively, this “Agreement”). By
      accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and
      represent that you have read and understood its terms. Please read this Agreement
      carefully, as it contains information concerning your legal rights and limitations on
      these rights, as well as a section regarding applicable law and jurisdiction of disputes. If you do not accept all of these terms and conditions, you are not authorized to use
      the Services. If you have a DayTrit account and wish to terminate this Agreement, you
      can do so at any time by closing your account and no longer accessing or using the
      Services (a description of how to do so is available here). Any information, text, links, graphics, photos, audio, videos, data, code or other
      materials or arrangements of materials that you can view on, access or otherwise
      interact with through the Services shall be referred to as “Content”. The terms “we”, “us”, “our” and “DayTrit” refer to DayTrit Projects Limited, a limited liability company
      located in Nigeria (“DayTrit”). “Services” as defined above refers to those provided by
      DayTrit or our corporate affiliates (DayTrit and such entities, when one or more are
      referred to, shall be collectively defined as the “DayTrit Companies”). For the
      avoidance of doubt, the websites are all owned and controlled by DayTrit. However, some specific Services made available via the websites may be owned and controlled
      by DayTrit’s corporate affiliates, for example Services facilitating the booking of
      Vacation Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with third-party
      suppliers (see below). The term “you” refers to the individual, company, business organization, or other legal
      entity using the Services and/or contributing Content to them. The Content that you
      contribute, submit, transmit and/or post to or through the Services shall be referred
      to variously as “your Content”, “Content of yours”, and/or “Content you submit.” The Services are provided solely to:
      Provide customers with travel information, posting Content, free treats and gifts and
      searching for and booking travel services and reservations; and
      Assist travel, tourism and hospitality businesses in engaging with customers and
      potential customers, by way of free and/or paid-for services offered by or through the
      DayTrit Companies.
      We may change or otherwise modify this Agreement in the future in accordance with
      the terms and conditions herein, and you understand and agree that your continued
      access or use of the Services after such change signifies your acceptance of the
      updated or modified Agreement. We will note the date that revisions were last made
      to this Agreement at the bottom of this Agreement, and any revisions will take effect
      upon posting. We will notify registered users of our Services (such registered users to
      be referred to as “Account Holders”) of material changes to these terms and
      conditions by either sending a notice to the email address associated with the Account
      Holder’s profile or by placing a notice on our websites. Be sure to return to this page
      periodically to review the most current version of this Agreement. USE OF THE SERVICES
      As a condition of your use of the Services, you warrant that (i) all information
      supplied by via the Services to the DayTrit Companies is true, accurate, current and
      complete, (ii) if you are an Account Holder, you will safeguard your account
      information and will supervise and be completely responsible for any use of your
      account by anyone other than you, (iii) you are 13 years of age or older (in some
      jurisdictions, local laws may have an older age requirement) in order to register for
      an account, use the Services and contribute to our app, and (iv) you possess the legal
      authority to enter into this Agreement and to use the Services, including our app in
      accordance with all terms and conditions herein. The DayTrit Companies do not
      knowingly collect the information of anyone under the age of 13. We retain the right
      at our sole discretion to deny anyone access to the Services, at any time and for any
      reason, including, but not limited to, for violation of this Agreement. By using the
      Services, including any products or services that facilitate the sharing of Content to or
      from third party sites, you understand that you are solely responsible for any
      information that you share with the DayTrit Companies. You may access the Services
      solely as intended through the provided functionality of the Services and as permitted
      under this Agreement. In order to access certain features of the Services, you will need to become an Account
      Holder by creating an account. When you create an account, you must provide
      complete and accurate information. You are solely responsible for the activity that
      occurs on your account, including your interaction and communication with others, and you must safeguard your account. Towards this end, if you are an Account Holder, you agree to keep your contact information up to date. If you are creating a DayTrit account for commercial purposes and are accepting this
      Agreement on behalf of a company, organization, or other legal entity, you represent
      and warrant that you are authorized to do so and have the authority to bind such
      entity to this Agreement, in which case the words “you” and “your” as used in this
      Agreement shall refer to such entity and the individual acting on behalf of the
      company shall be referred to as a “Business Representative.” Through your use of the Services you may encounter links to third party sites and
      apps or be able to interact with third party sites and apps. This may include the ability
      to share Content from the Services, including your Content, with such third party sites
      and apps. Please be aware that third party sites and apps may publicly display such
      shared Content. Such third parties may charge a fee for use of certain content or
      services provided on or by way of their websites. Therefore, you should make
      whatever investigation you feel is necessary or appropriate before proceeding with
      any transaction with any third party to determine whether a charge will be incurred. Where the DayTrit Companies provide details of fees or charges for such third party
      content or services, such information is provided for convenience and information
      purposes only. Any interactions with third party sites and apps are at your own risk. You expressly acknowledge and agree that the DayTrit Companies are in no way
      responsible or liable for any such third party sites or apps. Some Content you see or otherwise access on or through the Services is used for
      commercial purposes. You agree and understand that the DayTrit Companies may
      place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or
      otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic
      content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. USER GENERATED CONTENT
      DayTrit has the right to remove any content or information that violates the Terms of
      Use or when required by law. The service may be discontinued, and your access to
      DayTrit products may be terminated or disabled if you create legal exposure, violate
      the policies, infringe intellectual property rights or pose a risk to the community. In
      certain situations, the service may be changed or discontinued to avoid legal or
      regulatory impacts. If you believe that your account has been deleted in error or want
      to delete your account, you may refer to the Help Center. Content will be deleted
      within 30 days of your request. It may take up to 60 days to remove content from
      backups and disaster recovery systems after it has been deleted. In some cases, content cannot be deleted within 60 days of account deletion or
      content deletion process initiation. These situations include when content has been
      used by others according to the license, or when technical limitations prevent deletion. Additionally, content may be retained if necessary to investigate illegal activity, protect the safety and security of the products and users, comply with a legal
      obligation, or comply with a request from a judicial or administrative authority, law
      enforcement, or government agency.
      If you delete your account, these Terms will no longer apply. However, the section
      titled "Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree" and the above section will
      continue to apply even after account termination, deletion, or disabling. ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS
      The DayTrit Companies may, from time to time, decide to change, update or
      discontinue certain products and features of the Services. You agree and understand
      that the DayTrit Companies have no obligation to store or maintain your Content or
      other information you provide, except to the extent required by applicable law. We also offer other services that may be governed by additional terms or agreements. If you use any other such services, the additional terms will be made available and will
      become part of this Agreement, except where such additional terms expressly exclude
      or otherwise supersede this Agreement. For example, if you use or purchase such
      additional services for commercial or business purposes, you must agree to the
      applicable additional terms. To the extent any other terms conflict with the terms and
      conditions of this Agreement, the additional terms shall govern to the extent of the
      conflict with respect to those specific services. PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES
      The Content and information available on and through the Services (including, but not

      (ix) download any Content unless it’s expressly made available for download by the
      DayTrit Companies. REVIEWS, COMMENTS AND USE OF OTHER INTERACTIVE AREAS; LICENSE GRANT
      We appreciate hearing from you. Please be aware that by providing your Content to or
      through the Services, be it via email, posting via any DayTrit synchronization product, via the services and applications of others, or otherwise, including any of your Content
      that is transmitted to your DayTrit account by virtue of any DayTrit Companies
      product or service, reviews, questions, photographs or videos, comments, suggestions, ideas or the like contained in any of your Content, you grant the DayTrit
      Companies a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, transferable, irrevocable and fully
      sub-licensable right to (a) host, use, reproduce, modify, run, adapt, translate, distribute, publish, create derivative works from and publicly display and perform
      such Content of yours throughout the world in any media, now known or hereafter
      devised; (b) make your Content available to the rest of the world and to let others do
      the same; (c) to provide, promote, and improve the Services and to make your
      Content shared on the Services available to other companies, organizations or
      individuals for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, promotion or publication of
      such Content of yours on other media and services, subject to our Privacy Policy and
      this Agreement; and (d) use the name and/or trademark that you submit in
      connection with such Content of yours. You acknowledge that DayTrit may choose to
      provide attribution of your Content at our discretion. You further grant the DayTrit
      Companies the right to pursue at law any person or entity that violates your or the
      DayTrit Companies rights in your Content by a breach of this Agreement. You
      acknowledge and agree that your Content is non-confidential and non-proprietary. You affirm, represent, and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights
      (including copyright and other proprietary rights), consents, and permissions to
      publish and otherwise use (and for the DayTrit Companies to publish and otherwise
      use) your Content as authorized under this Agreement. If it is determined that you retain moral rights (including rights of attribution or
      integrity) in your Content, you hereby declare that, to the extent permitted by
      applicable law, (a) you do not require that any personally identifying information be
      used in connection with the Content, or any derivative works of or upgrades or
      updates thereto; (b) you have no objection to the publication, use, modification, deletion and exploitation of your Content by the DayTrit Companies or their licensees, successors and assigns; (c) you forever waive and agree not to claim or assert any
      entitlement to any and all moral rights of an author in any of your Content; and (d)
      you forever release the DayTrit Companies and their licensees, successors and
      assigns, from any claims that you could otherwise assert against the DayTrit
      Companies by virtue of any such moral rights. Note that any feedback and other suggestions you provide may be used at any time
      and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential. The Services may contain discussion forums, bulletin boards, review services, travel
      feeds or other forums in which you may post your Content, such as reviews of travel
      experiences, messages, materials or other items ("Interactive Areas"). If DayTrit
      provides such Interactive Areas on the websites, you are solely responsible for your
      use of such Interactive Areas and use them at your own risk. The DayTrit Companies
      do not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any of your Content you provide
      to the Services or in any Interactive Area. To the extent that any entity that is one of
      the DayTrit Companies provides any form of private communication channel between
      Account Holders, you agree that such entity(ies) may monitor the substance of such
      communications in order to help safeguard our community and the Services. You
      understand that the DayTrit Companies do not edit or control the user messages
      posted to or distributed through the Services, including through any chat rooms, bulletin boards or other communications forums, and will not be in any way
      responsible or liable for such messaging. In particular, DayTrit does not edit or
      control users’ Content that appears on the app. The DayTrit Companies nevertheless
      reserve the right to remove without notice any such messaging or other Content from
      the Services, where they believe in good faith that such Content breaches this
      Agreement or otherwise believe the removal is reasonably necessary to safeguard the
      rights of the DayTrit Companies and/or other users of the Services. Should you
      disagree with the removal of your Content from the app, you may contact DayTrit
      using the Help Center to make your objections. By using any Interactive Areas, you
      expressly agree only to submit Content of yours that complies with DayTrit published
      guidelines, as are in force at the time of submission and made available to you by
      DayTrit. You expressly agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services any Content of yours that:
      Is false, unlawful, misleading, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, indecent,
      lewd, suggestive, harassing (or advocates harassment of another person), threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, inflammatory, fraudulent
      or otherwise objectionable;
      Is patently offensive to the online community, such as that which promotes racism, bigotry, hatred or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual;
      Would constitute, encourage, promote or provide instructions for conduct of an illegal
      activity, a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate the rights of any party in
      any country of the world, or that would otherwise create liability or violate any local, state, national or international law, including, without limitation, the regulations of the
      Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or any rules of any securities
      exchange;
      Provides instructional information about illegal activities such as making or buying
      illegal weapons, violating someone’s privacy, or providing or creating computer
      viruses;
      May infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or
      proprietary right of any party. In particular, content that promotes an illegal or
      unauthorized copy of another’s copyrighted work, such as providing pirated computer
      programs or links to them, providing information to circumvent
      manufacturer-installed copy-protect devices, or providing pirated music or links to
      pirated music files;
      Constitutes mass mailings or “spamming”, “junk mail”, “chain letters” or “pyramid
      schemes”;

      websites, but only where express permission of the identified individual has been
      secured beforehand;
      Contains restricted or password only access pages, or hidden pages or images (those

      Include or are intended to facilitate viruses, corrupted data or other harmful, disruptive or destructive files;
      Is unrelated to the topic of the Interactive Area(s) in which such Content is posted; or
      In the sole judgment of DayTrit, (a) violates the previous subsections herein, (b)
      violates DayTrit related guidelines as made available to you by DayTrit, (c) is
      objectionable, (d) restricts or inhibits any other person from using or enjoying the
      Interactive Areas or any other aspect of the Services, or (e) may expose any of the
      DayTrit Companies or their users to any harm or liability of any type. The DayTrit Companies take no responsibility and assume no liability for any Content
      posted, stored, transmitted or uploaded to the Services by you (in the case of your
      Content) or any third party (in the case of any and all Content more generally), or for
      any loss or damage thereto, nor are the DayTrit Companies liable for any mistakes, defamation, slander, libel, omissions, falsehoods, obscenity, pornography or profanity
      you may encounter. As a provider of interactive services, the DayTrit is not liable for
      any statements, representations or any other Content provided by its users (including
      you as to your Content) in the websites or any other forum. Although the DayTrit has
      no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed
      through any Interactive Area, DayTrit reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on
      the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by
      third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies
      of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the
      Services at your sole cost and expense. Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the
      foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the
      Services more generally. Restricting DayTrit’s License Rights. You may elect on a going forward basis to limit
      the DayTrit Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described
      above) by opting to provide the DayTrit Companies with a more limited license as
      described further below (such limited license to be referred to herein as a “Restricted
      License”). You may make this election by selecting such Restricted License
      grant here (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account). If you
      make this election, the rights you grant the DayTrit Companies to your Content
      pursuant to the license terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard License”)
      shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly
      below, such that the DayTrit Companies shall not hold a Standard License to any of
      your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you
      post (as to which the DayTrit Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard
      License), but shall be granted a “Restricted License” as to the balance of your Content
      as defined below:
      When you post your Content to the Services, the license you grant the DayTrit
      Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate, and create derivative works of
      your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your
      name and/or trademark in connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6
      below, the Restricted License applies to any of your Content (again, other than
      text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g., a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available
      on or in connection with the Services. As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted License, you
      can terminate the DayTrit Companies’ license rights hereunder to such by deleting
      such post from the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the DayTrit
      Companies’ license rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted
      License by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is
      available here). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall
      remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or
      stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be
      displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or
      terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not
      publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in
      backup copy form for a period of time. The DayTrit Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products
      and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including
      sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the DayTrit Companies
      may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or
      otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic
      content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others. In
      all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide
      attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with
      your Content. The DayTrit Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content
      beyond the Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made
      "public" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of
      embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips
      you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search
      engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services. Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your
      and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this
      Agreement. The license you grant the DayTrit Companies as modified by these
      paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted License”. For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other
      DayTrit Companies services or programs is not subject to the Restricted License, but
      shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific
      DayTrit service or program. BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH DayTrit
      Use of DayTrit Booking Services. The DayTrit Companies offer you the ability to
      search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without
      leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become
      an Account Holder if you are not one already. By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described
      in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your
      individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or
      older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the
      Services (including the DayTrit Companies’ booking facilitation services) in
      accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and
      accurate. You further agree that you will use the DayTrit Companies’ booking
      facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom
      you are legally authorized to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and
      any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING DayTrit COMPANIES’ BOOKING
      FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE DayTrit
      COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY
      UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND
      (2) THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU
      TO INCUR LIABILITY TO DayTrit, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. When you book a reservation facilitated by the DayTrit Companies, your payment
      information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the
      transaction, as described in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the
      DayTrit Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your
      reservation.
      The DayTrit Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the
      right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating
      circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have
      reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The
      DayTrit Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to
      process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but
      becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier
      to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The DayTrit Companies are not travel agencies and do not
      provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the DayTrit Companies display information about
      properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain

      way imply, suggest, or constitute the DayTrit Companies’ sponsorship or approval of
      third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the DayTrit Companies and
      third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular
      transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or
      experiences based on their own experiences, the DayTrit Companies do not endorse
      or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that DayTrit
      does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account
      Holders. The DayTrit Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or
      otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation, or

      liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the DayTrit Companies are
      not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from
      third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this
      Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions
      of purchase and website use, privacy policy, and any other rules or policies related to
      the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your

      Booking Vacation Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party
      Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of DayTrit’s corporate affiliates act
      as marketplaces to facilitate travelers’ ability to (1) enter into vacation rental
      agreements with property owners and managers (“Vacation Rentals”), (2) make
      reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such
      Experiences (each such supplier of a vacation rental and/or Experience to be referred
      to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of DayTrit syndicate their
      advertisements to other entities within the DayTrit Companies group and that is why
      you see them on the DayTrit Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be
      responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the DayTrit
      Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Vacation Rentals, Restaurants or
      Experiences facilitated by DayTrit’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage, or
      contract for any Vacation Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither DayTrit nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Vacation Rental
      transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between
      travelers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential
      transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety
      or legality of a listed Vacation Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the
      listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Vacation Rental property, provide you
      with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or
      your ability to pay for a Vacation Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an
      Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of DayTrit corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for
      the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an
      Advertiser, or a DayTrit corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent
      on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any
      Vacation Rental reservation or Experience. For further information on Vacation Rental fees, security deposits, fees for
      Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit Viator; for Restaurants visit The Fork; for
      vacation rentals, visit Tripadvisor Companies' Vacation Rentals. By making a Vacation
      Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by
      one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms
      and conditions, as well as its privacy policy. If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for
      resolving that dispute are available online

      International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party
      suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for
      ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents,
      including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate
      for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for
      up-to-date information before booking and departure. The DayTrit Companies accept
      no liability for travelers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because
      of the traveler’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority, or country, including countries the traveler may just be passing through en route to
      his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on
      inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health
      entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip. Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed
      without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. DayTrit urges travelers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination
      country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. BY LISTING INFORMATION RELEVANT TO TRAVEL TO PARTICULAR INTERNATIONAL
      DESTINATIONS, THE DayTrit COMPANIES DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT
